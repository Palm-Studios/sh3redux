/** @file
 *  Describes the structures necessary to load/read Silent Hill 3 .arc files
 *  (including @c arc.arc, the master file table).
 *
 *   The structure of the .arc system is as follows:
 *
 *                   arc.arc (MFT)
 *                       |
 *                       | (File name translation to section name)
 *           /-----/-----|-----\-----\
 *          |     |      |      |     |
 *       pic.arc  chrbg.arc msg.arc tex.arc
 *          |         |        |       |    (Translation to section offset)
 *          |         |        |       |
 *         File      File     File    File
 *
 *   The files branching from the MFT are NOT compressed, however, @c arc.arc is compressed using
 *   gzip compression format. @c arc.arc basically acts as a Master File Table (or rather a root directory).
 *
 *   It is probably a good idea to (at launch) load the MFT and map each file in a map (see @ref sh3_arc_section::fileList)
 *   so that we can quickly look up and load a file in a section without having to transverse the MFT everytime,
 *   though it can be made quicker by skipping sections (which is most likely how Konami implemented it).
 *
 *   After we have a handle to @c arc.arc, we can now load each section (as Mike has designated them) or as I like
 *   to call them (and perhaps more appropriately), sub arcs. These are the files found in @c /data/ of a regular
 *   install of SILENT HILL 3 on the PC. These sections contain information about each file contained within,
 *   such as a Virtual File Path (e.g @c /data/pic/it/it_xxxx.tex, then translated to an offset), the offset
 *   within the section it is located in, as well as the index of the section (for reasons that elude me).
 *
 *   It is currently unknown how the programmers at Konami specified which files should be loaded when, but
 *   considering the very quick load times, I would assume that each part of the game is in its own individual
 *   sub arc/section, as Mike seems to have not found
