/** @page arc-files The .arc files
 *  A description of the @c .arc files and how they are related.
 *
 *  The structure of the @c .arc system is as follows:
 *
 *                     arc.arc (MFT)
 *                        |
 *                        | (File name translation to section name)
 *          +--------+----+----+-------+
 *          |        |         |       |
 *       pic.arc chrbg.arc  msg.arc tex.arc
 *          |        |         |       |    (Translation to section offset)
 *          |        |         |       |
 *         File     File      File    File
 *
 *  @c arc.arc is compressed using the gzip compression format, while the files branching from it (sub-arcs) are not.
 *  @c arc.arc acts as a Master File Table. The file is modeled with @ref sh3::arc::mft.
 *
 *  At launch, the MFT is parsed and a mapping from filename to its location is created (@ref sh3::arc::subarc::files)
 *  so that we can quickly look up and load a file in a section without having to transverse the MFT everytime,
 *  though it could be made quicker by skipping sections (which is most likely how Konami implemented it).
 *
 *  After we have a handle to @c arc.arc, we can load each sub-arc. These are the files found in @c /data/
 *  of a regular install of SILENT HILL 3 on the PC. The sub-arcs contain information about the contained files,
 *  such as a Virtual File Path (e.g @c /data/pic/it/it_xxxx.tex, then translated to an offset), the offset
 *  within the sub-arc, as well as the index of the sub-arc (for reasons yet unknown).
 *  The sub-arcs are modeled with @ref sh3::arc::subarc.
 *
 *  It is currently not known how the programmers at Konami specified which files should be loaded when, but
 *  considering the very quick load times, the assumption is that each part of the game is in its own individual
 *  sub-arc, as Mike seems to have not found.
