# sh3redux
SILENT HILL 3 Engine Remake in OpenGL and C++

## Building
Currently, the libraries required to build sh3redux are as follows:

1.SDL2
2.GLEW
3.FTGL and Freetype
4.zlib

Once you have the required libraries, there are two ways to build:

1. Run cmake on CMakeLists (Recommended)
2. Open the Code::Blocks project

Note that if you open the Code::Blocks project, you will have to set search paths etc yourself (as they may not have been updated, i.e, you probably WILL get build errors). It is there as a fallback/for people who don't necessarily know/like cmake
